## Shutting it down

I've been MIA from this blog for a bit, so apologies on the recent lack of posting.  Have been focusing a lot on work and personal life, so I've neglected this quite a bit.

Anyways, I'm just here to say that I'm shutting down my little book-data website [nextnovelproject](/projects/next-novel-project/).  It was only up and running for about 7 or 8 months, but definitely learned a few things through the process: 

- The site was definitely educational to build.  Had to set up a few databases and data pipelines on AWS to make everything work.

- Interesting to see the challenges of marketing a small product / website.  Even making a site that *I* thought was interesting wasn't enough to actually make people use it.

- I doubt I'll ever make another project that depends on a third-party API ever again.  [Goodreads'](https://www.goodreads.com/) deprication of a barely-supported API was just the final nail in the coffin of the project.  Not to mention, got a few questions on why the data on my website was suspect - blaming a data provider doesn't do anything to improve your project though.
